# Jammming

Hi, it's been a full year since I left coding due to family matter. So, I have been doing the full-stack engineer course path from an online platform, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) as a quick skill-refresher. This **Jammming** project is the first front-end app from the course path that I built using with react and tailwind (a cool utility-first css framework).

### Project Description

Jammming is a one-simple-page of react application which utilize Spotify API to create a new playlist for spotify users. The functionalities within the app are limited to:

- Searching tracks, artists, and albums
- Add tracks to not yet created playlist
- Remove tracks from not yet created playlist
- Save newly created playlist to the user

### Tech Stacks

- React
- Tailwind CSS

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
